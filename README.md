# landing-page

This is the second project for The Odin Project.

In this project, I hope to use what i have learned to create a web page from scratch, 
using provided design images. This is also a chance to continue practice using git for version control.

Skills Used:

Basic HTML setup
CSS for styling text and background colors

CSS flexbox for page layout

How to correctly layout page when the browser size changes
